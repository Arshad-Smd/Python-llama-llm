# Fine-tuning Meta's Llama 2 Model using Intel's oneAPI Hardware and Intel Optimization Libraries for Hugging Face Transformers

This project involves fine-tuning the Meta's Llama 2 model using Intel's oneAPI hardware and Intel Optimization Libraries for Hugging Face Transformers. Below are the step-by-step instructions for each process: 

#   Configuring Model for 4-bit Quantization :

In this step, we configure the large Meta's Llama 2 model for 4-bit quantization, enabling it to be loaded and utilized efficiently on limited hardware resources. This process involves employing advanced techniques such as LORA (Low-Rank Adaptation) and QLORA (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation) to compress the model's parameters without significant loss in performance.

**LORA (Low-Rank Adaptation):**
LORA is a technique used to reduce the computational complexity of deep neural networks by approximating the weight matrices with low-rank factors. By decomposing the weight matrices into low-rank matrices, LORA reduces the number of parameters in the model, making it more suitable for deployment on resource-constrained hardware.

**QLORA (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation):**
QLORA extends the benefits of low-rank approximation to quantized neural networks. It combines low-rank approximation with quantization techniques to further compress the model's parameters while maintaining acceptable levels of accuracy. By quantizing the low-rank factors, QLORA achieves higher compression ratios without sacrificing performance.

By applying LORA and QLORA techniques to the Meta's Llama 2 model, we can effectively reduce its parameter size while preserving its representational capacity. This enables the model to be loaded and executed efficiently on hardware with limited memory and computational capabilities, making it suitable for deployment in real-world applications.

# Dataset preperation for Text-to-Python Code Conversion

Firstly, we preprocess the dataset obtained from the Hugging Face Datasets library to ensure compatibility with the Meta's Llama 2 model. This involves converting the dataset into the prompt template format accepted by the model, which consists of the following structure: **s [inst] instruction [\inst] answer s** Here, [inst] represents the start of the instruction, [\inst] marks the end of the instruction, and answer denotes the corresponding Python code snippet. Each pair of instruction and Python code snippet is enclosed within s and s tags, signifying the beginning and end of the sequence, respectively.


# Model Fine-Tuning Using Hugging Face Trainer Class

After preparing the dataset and quantizing the Meta's Llama 2 model for efficient utilization, the training process begins using the Hugging Face Trainer class. This class provides a streamlined interface for training transformer models, simplifying the training workflow and enabling experimentation with different configurations. The training configuration, including batch size, learning rate, optimizer, and number of epochs, is specified before initiating the training process. The prepared dataset, formatted in the prompt template structure, is loaded into the Trainer class, with automatic handling of data shuffling, batching, and preprocessing.During the training loop orchestrated by the Trainer class, the model receives natural language instructions as input and generates corresponding Python code snippets as output. Backpropagation and optimization techniques, such as gradient descent or its variants, are employed to update the model's parameters iteratively.


# Leveraging Intel Hardware and oneAPI Optimization Libraries for Fine-tuning

Transformers, the backbone of advanced tasks like natural language processing and computer vision, demand significant computational resources for effective training. This challenge prompted Intel to collaborate with Hugging Face, renowned for its transformers library, to present an end-to-end optimization solution for transformers training and inference. Through multi-node, distributed CPU fine-tuning, utilizing Hugging Face transformers with Intel's Accelerate library and Extension for PyTorch, hyperparameter optimization becomes seamless. Additionally, inference optimization, including model quantization and distillation using Optimum for Intel, is streamlined through the interface between transformers library and Intel tools. This collaboration not only simplifies the training process but also ensures efficient utilization of Intel Xeon Scalable processors, enhancing transformer performance.


# Deployment on Hugging Face Cloud with Intel OpenVINO

After fine-tuning the model, the deployment process is seamlessly executed on the Hugging Face cloud infrastructure, thanks to the integration of Intel OpenVINO. By joining the OpenVINO community and creating a dedicated repository, the model is uploaded, ready for deployment. Intel OpenVINO provides open-source hardware support, enabling efficient execution of the model within the Hugging Face cloud environment. This collaboration between Hugging Face and Intel ensures smooth deployment and operation of the fine-tuned model, maximizing performance and scalability.
